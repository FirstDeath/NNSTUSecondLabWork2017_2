# NNSTU Second Lab Work

This project is used to create multiple implementations of the client-server chat application by groups of students.

## Prerequisites

Don't forget to do the following, if you are able to add **\*.iml** files to VCS:

* In Intellij IDEA, go to *File > Settings > Version Control > Ignored Files* and add **.idea** directory and **\*.iml** file mask to avoid unnecessary file commits.

To preserve good code style and reduce the amount of potential bugs:

* Install `SonarLint` plugin to perform automatic static code analysis.
* Use `Ctrl + Alt + L` to fix code formatting.
* Use `Ctrl + Alt + O` to organize imported classes.

To start working under your project, you need to:

* Make a *Checkout* form current repository - `master` branch.
* Create a new *branch*.
* Delete `...Stub.txt` file from your package and start working.
* *Commit and Push* your changes to GitHub.
* Create *Pull Request* in order to send for review and merge your changes with the `master` branch.
* Set correct *Assignees* (one of the **Authors**) and *Labels* for your *Pull Request* review. 

## Labels Purpose Description

* **Bug** - reviewer have found an issue / CI issue / merge issue / static code analysis issue.
* **Duplicate** - if *Pull Request* was duplicated.
* **Enhancement** - use to mark *Pull Request* with code enhancements.
* **Help Wanted** - developer has encountered unresolvable issue / is not sure about code workflow / needs an advice.
